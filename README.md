## Overview
### Microsoft wants to venture into the film industry. They have tasked me to do an analysis that will enable them make an informed decision based on the best performing film studio's, their movie production and profitability as well as the genre's in high production and demand.
## Business Problem
### Microsoft would like to expand their business niche due to the current trends where fellow big companies have been exploring and thriving on creating video content. They have created a new video studio but do not have the information to enable them make an informed decision on the kind of films to create, how to make profits, and generally how to set themselves apart in order to be the market leaders in this industry and remain relevant.

## The Data
### We will be analyzing data from the following sets:
* IMDB(Internet Movie Dataset)
* The MovieDB

## Comprehension Check
### This analysis involves responding to the following queries:
* Who are the key studio players in the market?
* What has been the yearly domestic gross?
* What genres are in the highest movie production?

## Analysis Overview
* Selecting the datasets
* Inspecting the datasets
* Cleaning the datasets
* Deriving statistical information
* Visualization
* Merging tables in the datasets
* Conclusions
* Recommendations

### Let's Kick The Ball Rolling
#### The dataset chosen was loaded, inspected, analyzed, cleaned, and used to generate descriptive statistics. See below visualizations encapsulating my conclusion and recommendations respectively. 

## Who are the key studio player's in the market?

#### From the above presentation we can see the top 10 studio's in the market. IFC, Universal Pictures and Warner Barner are the top 3 studio's. Potential contributing factor could be their diversification.

## What has been the yearly domestic gross?

#### The domestic gross has been increasing as from 2015 to 2018. This therefore suggests that Microsoft would make profits locally from producing movies as well. The business niche is profitable regardless of the reduction in the number of movie production as presented below:

##  What genres are in the highest movie production?

#### The genre Drama has the highest produced number of movies followed by comedy. The cost of making drama and comedy shows might be lower hence easier to produce more.

#### Here we see the domestic gross of the top 10 movies with the highest domestic gross by their studio's. BV appears to have made more income from its movie production.

## Conclusions
* The top 2 performing studio's are IFC and Universal Picture. The contributing factor to IFC and  Universal Picture success is the diversification. They have got something for everyone. This has enabled the company to capitalize on various revenue streams.
* We note a decline in the number of films release per year as from 2015 to 2018. The average domestic gross per year has been increasing as from 2015 to 2018 despite the reduction in the number of movies produced. 
* The studio with the highest domestic gross is BV which also has produced the 9 out of 10 top movie films.
* Drama is the most commonly produced movie genre followed by Comedy and Comedy/Drama.

## Recommendations
* I would recommend that the studio diversifies on the different types of films in order to have something for everyone. From my analysis above this has greatly influenced the top 3 studio companies.
* Prioritize quality over quantity as we note the number of movies do not correlate with the return of investment but most likely the quality of the films produced. BV studio has produced 9 out of 10 movies with the highest domestic gross but the studio itself does not have many movies in terms of quantity produced.
* Consider also producing the films under the genre Drama and Comedy as we note the number of movie production in this genre was high. It could possibly mean that the market demand is high.
* I recommend that Microsoft also consider exploring the genres Sci-Fi and Adventure. This had the highest number of votes which would positively relate to the views and the average rating being above average.
